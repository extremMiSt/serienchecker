# serienchecker
an old project for keeping track of what series and episodes I have watched.
I had to change it recently for changes with imdb, so I just put it into a git when I was doing that.

known issues:
 * the window will sometimes jump around, can't be bothered to fix that
 * the imdb scraping is rather volatile, due to changes happening regularly at imdb
